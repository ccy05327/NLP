          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Emotion detection in text is a growing field within Natural Language
            Processing (NLP), focused on identifying the underlying emotional
            tone of written language. As digital communication continues to
            dominate online platforms, the ability to recognise emotions in
            short texts such as tweets or chat messages has significant
            practical relevance. Applications range from enhancing customer
            service and monitoring digital well-being to developing more
            empathetic chatbots and effective content moderation tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methodology for accomplishing this task has evolved
            significantly, shifting from classical machine learning techniques
            to more advanced deep learning architectures. Recent literature
            demonstrates a clear performance advantage for modern
            transformer-based models, which leverage contextual understanding of
            language. For instance, a comparative study on Twitter data found
            that a BERT model achieved a higher classification accuracy (75.6%)
            than a traditional Support Vector Machine (71.6%) on the same task
            (Wicaksono &amp; Cahyaningrum, 2024). Within the transformer
            paradigm itself, a performance hierarchy is also evident; research
            on formal datasets shows that larger, optimised models like RoBERTa
            can outperform more lightweight variants such as DistilBERT
            (Dellâ€™Orletta et al., 2021). However, this increase in accuracy
            often comes with a significant trade-off in computational cost and
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on this context, this project conducts a direct comparative
            analysis to investigate these trade-offs in a practical setting. It
            implements two distinct models for emotion detection on short-form
            text: a classical model (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features)
            and an efficient, contemporary transformer model (a fine-tuned
            DistilBERT). By evaluating both approaches on the same dataset, this
            study aims to provide a practical comparison of their performance,
            highlighting the relationship between contextual understanding,
            computational resources, and classification accuracy.

          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comparative
            analysis of two distinct machine learning paradigms for the task of
            emotion detection in short-form text. The study aims to implement
            and evaluate both a traditional statistical model and a modern,
            embedding-based transformer model to provide a clear, evidence-based
            assessment of their respective capabilities and trade-offs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific objectives required to achieve this goal are as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To implement two separate data pre-processing pipelines tailored
              to the unique input requirements of statistical and
              transformer-based models
            </li>
            <li>
              To build and train a classical classifier using Logistic
              Regression with TF-IDF features, establishing a robust statistical
              baseline
            </li>
            <li>
              To fine-tune a pre-trained DistilBERT model to serve as an example
              of an efficient, contemporary embedding-based approach
            </li>
            <li>
              To perform a rigorous, quantitative evaluation of both models on a
              held-out test set, using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to
              compare their performance directly
            </li>
            <li>
              To analyse the results critically, discussing not only the
              performance differences but also the practical trade-offs
              regarding computational efficiency and model interpretability
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By fulfilling these objectives, this project will contribute a
            reproducible and practical comparison that highlights the strengths
            and weaknesses of each approach, offering insight into model
            selection for real-world emotion detection applications.

          <h2>Performance Analysis & Comparative Discussion</h2>
          <p>
            The evaluation of the three models on the held-out test set reveals
            a clear performance hierarchy, confirming the effectiveness of
            modern transformer architectures over traditional statistical
            methods for this task. The final performance metrics are summarised
            below:
          </p>
          <table class="dataframe">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Model</th>
                <th>Accuracy</th>
                <th>Macro F1-score</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Naive Bayes (Baseline)</td>
                <td>0.8390 (83.90%)</td>
                <td>0.7537</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Logistic Regression</td>
                <td>0.8975 (89.75%)</td>
                <td>0.8635</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>DistilBERT (Fine-tuned)</strong></td>
                <td><strong>0.9305 (93.05%)</strong></td>
                <td><strong>0.8892</strong></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Quantitatively, the fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved the highest
            performance across both key metrics. It recorded an accuracy of
            93.05%, representing a significant improvement of +10.97% over the
            Naive Bayes baseline and a more moderate, yet still notable,
            improvement of +3.91% over the optimised Logistic Regression model.
            The Macro F1-score, which accounts for class imbalance by treating
            all classes equally, tells a similar story. DistilBERTâ€™s score of
            0.8892 surpasses that of Logistic Regression (0.8597) and
            significantly exceeds the baseline (0.7537), indicating its superior
            ability to classify minority classes effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            A qualitative analysis of the modelsâ€™ confusion matrices provides
            insight into these performance differences. While Logistic
            Regression performed well, it showed some confusion between
            semantically similar classes. In contrast, the DistilBERT model
            demonstrated a more refined classification ability, particularly
            with the minority emotion classes. For instance, both â€˜loveâ€™ and
            â€˜surpriseâ€™â€”the most challenging classes for the statistical
            modelsâ€”saw improved recall and F1-scores with DistilBERT. This
            suggests that the transformerâ€™s bidirectional attention mechanism is
            better able to capture the subtle contextual nuances that
            differentiate these emotions. The statistical models, relying on
            TF-IDF features, are limited to word co-occurrence and frequency,
            whereas DistilBERT can interpret the semantic meaning of the text,
            leading to fewer misclassifications in ambiguous cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, while the optimised Logistic Regression classifier
            provides a very strong and efficient benchmark, the superior
            performance of the fine-tuned DistilBERT model validates the
            hypothesis that embedding-based models, with their deep contextual
            understanding, are better suited for complex NLP tasks like emotion
            detection.

          <h2>Project Summary and Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            This project successfully implemented and evaluated three distinct
            models for text-based emotion detection, culminating in a direct
            comparison between a classical statistical approach and a modern
            transformer architecture. The primary objectiveâ€”to conduct a
            comparative analysis of these methodologiesâ€”was fully achieved. The
            key finding confirms that while an optimised Logistic Regression
            model serves as a highly effective baseline, the fine-tuned
            DistilBERT model yields superior classification accuracy and a more
            robust F1-score across all emotion classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The projectâ€™s contribution lies in its practical validation of this
            performance hierarchy on a real-world dataset of short, informal
            texts. It highlights the fundamental trade-off between the two
            paradigms. The statistical approach, while less accurate, is
            computationally efficient, transparent, and highly interpretable, as
            demonstrated by the feature importance analysis. This makes it a
            suitable choice for low-resource environments or applications where
            model explainability is paramount. Conversely, the transformer
            model, despite its greater computational requirements for
            fine-tuning, offers state-of-the-art performance by leveraging its
            pre-trained knowledge to understand linguistic context, making it
            the preferred option for applications where maximum accuracy is the
            primary objective.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project was designed for reproducibility, with a clean codebase
            and the use of publicly available datasets and libraries. However,
            it is not without limitations. The analysis was conducted solely on
            an English-language dataset, and the models were not optimised for
            handling more complex linguistic phenomena such as sarcasm or irony.
            Future work could build upon this foundation by exploring several
            promising avenues:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Data Augmentation: Employing techniques like back-translation or
              synthetic oversampling to further mitigate the class imbalance
              issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advanced Architectures: Experimenting with larger or more
              specialised transformer models, such as RoBERTa, to potentially
              achieve even higher accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multilingual Analysis: Extending the comparative framework to
              non-English datasets to assess the generalisability of these
              findings across different languages.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In conclusion, this comparative study provides a clear and valuable
            insight into the current state of emotion detection, offering a
            solid and reproducible foundation for both academic research and the
            development of practical, emotion-aware applications.
